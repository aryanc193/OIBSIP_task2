        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>
          Vincent van Gogh, born on March 30, 1853, in Zundert, Netherlands, was
          a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is widely considered one of the
          most influential figures in Western art. Despite facing numerous
          personal challenges and struggling with mental health issues, van Gogh
          produced an extensive body of work that has had a profound impact on
          the art world.<br />
          <br />
          Van Gogh began his artistic journey relatively late in life, taking up
          painting in his late twenties. His early works were influenced by the
          Dutch Masters and the Barbizon school, but he later developed a unique
          and recognizable style characterized by bold colors, dramatic
          brushstrokes, and emotional intensity.<br />
          <br />
          The artist's life was marked by poverty, emotional turbulence, and
          frequent moves between cities in Europe. He spent time in Paris, where
          he interacted with other prominent artists of the time, including Paul
          Gauguin. The famous incident in which van Gogh famously severed his
          own ear during a bout of mental distress occurred in Arles in 1888.<br />
          <br />
          Despite his struggles, van Gogh created some of his most iconic works
          during the last few years of his life, including "Starry Night,"
          "Irises," and "Sunflowers." Tragically, he succumbed to mental illness
          and died on July 29, 1890, at the age of 37, never having achieved
          widespread recognition during his lifetime.
          <br /><br />
          Posthumously, Vincent van Gogh's contributions to art have been
          celebrated, and he is now regarded as one of the most influential and
          revered figures in the history of Western art. His legacy endures
          through the timeless beauty and emotional depth of his paintings.

        <h1>Artistic Style</h1>
        <p>
          Vincent van Gogh's artistic style is characterized by bold colors,
          expressive brushstrokes, and emotional intensity. He was a
          Post-Impressionist painter who departed from the traditional artistic
          techniques of his time. Van Gogh used vivid and often contrasting
          colors to convey emotion and atmosphere in his works. His brushstrokes
          were dynamic and visible, adding a sense of movement and energy to his
          paintings.
          <br /><br />
          Van Gogh's unique approach to texture and form, such as the thick
          application of paint (impasto), created a tactile quality in his
          works. His compositions often featured everyday subjects like
          landscapes, portraits, and still life, transformed through his
          distinctive interpretation.
          <br /><br />
          Over time, van Gogh's style evolved, reflecting his emotional and
          mental state. His later works, like "Starry Night," are particularly
          known for their swirling, turbulent compositions and intense colors.
          Despite facing personal challenges, van Gogh's innovative and
          expressive style has had a profound and lasting influence on the art
          world.
